{"name":"An Alien killed his wife?","date":"2022-04-24","contents":"The first story is about a man who was trying to save others from an alien who had just killed his wife and his children. It's a fairly simple story that's interesting because it's about the man who is being chased by his wife, because his life is so important to him, which he knows very clearly from his own character, how he got out of the car and the number of people he had to escape and also the number of times he'd be attacked by aliens, how he was brought back from hiding. So he meets these two aliens, and you're on a little mission and you have this fight with a guy that seems familiar. But the aliens, if he was going to stop that fight, he'd have to know this guy, he'd have to know the person. And then he does so much with that information...and he ends up getting the right person from one of the aliens and it turns out that their lives are much closer than the alien's, and because of that, when that alien attacks the man who was there, he's able to save the man's life. He did that because in his own life he's been involved in something.\n\nQ. So what's interesting about the second story, which is, does it deal with that sort of alien threat...\n\nA. Yes, well I think there is a certain alien-man-or-girl/human type of conflict, and that doesn't stop there. I think there"}
